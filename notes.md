- Remove unnecessary mirror for magic mount<br><br>Mirror was previously used for accessing the original file during<br>magic mount when we are using a tmpfs to cover the target. However,<br>since we introduce atomic mount, we switch all tmpfs mount in<br>worker and then move to the target at once. It means that we can<br>still access the original file when we are constructing the tmpfs<br>mount point. Thus we no longer need mirror.
